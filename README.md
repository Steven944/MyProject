How I expected the challenge to go 

I expected the project to go sooo much different to how it came out. I planned to make something to try
and impress that took a lot longer than I thought it would, countless
error messages and googling and going why isn't it working??? Was a huge
eye opener for me and I completely missed the deadline for the whole
project, I got some aspects of the project in for the deadline like the
backend code but it went absolutely nowhere near how I predicted it
would but hopefully I can learn from that.

What went well/What didn't go as planned 

I got off to a great start  with a solid plan in place but then stupidly got carried away and tried to
implement frontend into the project to try and impress. Which caused so
many problems and before I knew it, it had gone from saturday to tuesday
and i'd fallen way behind. I then had lots of problems with the backend
code with the login database not functioning correctly and getting error
message after error message, this took again a lot longer than intended
but I finally got everything to work friday lunchtime but by then it was
too late to get everything else completed and i'd completely messed it
up. Just did not time manage properly and was completely caught off
guard by all the problems and how long everything would take.

Possible improvements for future revisions of the project

Future improvements for the project will be to get a 90% test coverage
completed, then move onto working on the play button with a 3d model of
the weapons that you can pick for the game which changes based on the
attachments you choose from the database. Also when you press on the
login button I will make it redirect you to the customize weapon play
page.
